Monte Carlo.
============

If a single dice is thrown, there's an equal probability of each of the
"face" values 1 through 6. However, if ten dice are thrown together, the
sum of the face values of each throw will be a number between 10 and 60,
and will describe a normal distribution (so the value 35 will show up
far more often than the values 10 or 60).

Write a program that uses only Streams (in particular, it should use no
loops, and no "subString" operations that calculates the distribution for
a large number of throws (10,000 or more) and displays the frequency
distribution using ASCII graphics. So, the output should look similar to
this, but with longer lines, and numbers from 10 to 60:

10:
11: *
12: **
13: ****
14: ******
15: ****
16: **
17: *
18:

You might like to use the Stream.generate methods, perhaps either
Math.random() or ThreadLocalRandom.current.ints() in support of this
Your code should also avoid defining any string containing more than
one asterisk (just to make it more challenging!)
